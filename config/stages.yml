    questions:
      - "Databases: do you prefer (a) the status quo, with CS 348 in 3B; (b) a second-year-level full course in databases (SE 2xx); (c) 9 hours on writing SQL queries in ECE 192; or (d) no databases course?"
      - "What do you think about an overall goal of getting SE closer to 5 courses per term?"
      - "Should we strive for more flexibility in the program?"
      - "What are your feelings about adding an extra half-course (workload similar to SE 101) to 1B?"

    title: "This is a proposed course sequence that the curriculum committee is considering. Brief summary: 1B gets an extra half-course SE 192 (could have SQL); 2B gets a new DB course (or maybe SE 192 is enough on its own?) and loses MSCI 261 and MATH 213; 3A gains MATH 213; 3B loses CS 348 and gains ECE 358; 4A loses ECE 358 and gains an elective; one fewer elective in 4B. On the next page, you'll get a chance to move courses around."
